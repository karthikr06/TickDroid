# About TickDroid: 
Originally built with friends, it served as a friendly and useful utility for our community. Although the original source files were lost years ago, this project represents a fresh start. TickDroid has been rebuilt from scratch, featuring modern AI integration while maintaining its original goal: to be a helpful bot on your server.
